# Nancy as a smart city

The city of Nancy, France has put some public data over the last few months and I wanted to dig a bit into.

As a student living in Nancy, I can tell that the car flow isn't helped by the streets agencement and the work the city's been doing.

Among the open data, there was a JSON file listing the current works in the city with, for each of them, description, the street and most importantly, the location with latitude and longitude.

Knowing streamlit but never used it, I thought there was something to do ant that's why I propose you the link of this web app showing the current street works in Nancy.
Thanks ðŸ˜Š
